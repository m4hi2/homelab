# ~~🏠💪 Homelab~~ 🏭🦾 Cololab 🥷🚀

Welcome to my journey of learning automation tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes and many more.

My homelab is an old i5 16GB MacBook Pro from 2017. This device stated giving me trouble in my day to day work so decided to turn it into a Ubuntu Server few years back. Played with it over the years but it was always unstable. The hardware was damaged and it crashed frequently. The WiFi driver dropped connection. Even though the job of that machine was to let me experiment and help me learn, most of the time I found myself fixing it. Which was a bit furstrating. But I needed to learn new things...

I asked around, and one company agreed to help me with some nodes ([Check Sponsors](#sponsors)). The journey begins!
